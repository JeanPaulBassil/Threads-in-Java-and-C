# Main README.md for Java and C Threading Examples Repository

## Repository Overview
This repository contains a variety of examples showcasing different methods of implementing multi-threading in Java and C. Each folder contains specific examples along with README.md files explaining the concepts and usage. The examples range from basic thread creation to more complex scenarios like thread communication and priority management.

## Folder Structure and Descriptions

1. **anotherSummationJava**
   - Demonstrates Java multi-threading by calculating the sum of a range of numbers. Uses the `Runnable` interface and showcases thread synchronization with `join()`.

2. **PThreadsInC**
   - Contains examples of POSIX threads in C. It illustrates basic thread creation, execution, and synchronization in a C environment.

3. **twoThreadsCounting**
   - Showcases two threads running concurrently in Java. Each thread counts up to a certain number, demonstrating basic multi-threading concepts.

4. **extendingThreadsJava**
   - Features examples where threads are created by extending the `Thread` class in Java. It includes basic thread execution and thread lifecycle management.

5. **implementRunnableInterfaceJava**
   - Contains examples where Java threads are created by implementing the `Runnable` interface. Highlights the separation of task definition from thread management.

6. **summationJava**
   - Focuses on a single-threaded Java application that calculates the sum of numbers up to a specified upper limit. Demonstrates basic thread execution.

7. **threadsWithPriorityJava**
   - Includes Java examples that deal with setting and managing thread priorities. Useful for understanding how Java prioritizes thread execution.

## Usage
Each folder contains a specific example with its own README.md for detailed explanations. To explore an example, navigate into the folder and refer to its README.md for instructions and insights.
